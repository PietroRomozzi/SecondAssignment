We were both agree about working on health and interested in using Italy as a case study.

We started to explore some sub-issues of health and mental disorder, because of its relevance and of its multidimensionality, appeared to be a challenging and interesting topic to focus on.

Going trough some literature about it, we found some evidence of relationship between environmental factors and mental disorder and we also discovered that there are just a few studies exploring this relation.

So we worked on a model to dissect mental disorder trying to investigate the role of these variables often overlooked.

By now, we have been working on this work's proposal, starting to gather data and deciding an effective strategy to deal with the issues that will be covered in our work.
